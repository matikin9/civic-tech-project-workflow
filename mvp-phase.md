# MVP/Development Phase

You have arrived at the almighty MVP/Development Phase.

## If you are working on the MVP:

Give yourselves a **HARD 2-3 month deadline**.  Tell your friendly local Hack Night Host and they will schedule a date for the team to present at Hack Night.

You've already figured out the features, the technology, the tools... get developing!

For you non-coders, you can spend your time preparing the presentation.

Once you've hit your deadline and launched your MVP (woohoo!), take a breather and pat yourselves on the back.  You deserve it!

## If you've already launched your MVP and now you're iterating:

Keep doing your thing!  We may ask you to present at events, like Demo Nights.  Let the Hack Night Hosts know if you find you're starting to need additional resources, whether that's paying for services, needing more developers/designers, or money for marketing materials.

## Done?

Get the team together and hold a retrospective session:

* Was the Project section of the Planning Canvas satisfied?
* What went well?
* What didnâ€™t go so well?
* What has the team learned?
* What does the team still have questions about?

Document your retrospective in the repo, and then [let's move on](testing-phase.html).
