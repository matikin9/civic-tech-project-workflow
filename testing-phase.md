# Testing Phase

This phase includes:
* Feature testing
* Usability testing
* User testing

This is an opportunity to refine the strategy by checking in and seeing if we're still going in the right direction.  What still needs to be done to improve the solution?

Spend this time to focus harder on communication and outreach as well.  Possible tasks include:
* Running surveys and tests with actual users.
* Identifying and talking to potential partnership organizations (non-profits/government).
* Building up a social media presence, including on the Hack for LA accounts and with the larger Code for America network.  Develop and follow a marketing plan.
* Attending networking and community events.
* Giving presentations about the project at local events or to potential partners.

Once you've reached this phase, we'll ask you to present at Demo Nights (you've made it!).

Really start thinking about what a successful end state looks like for this project and what will need to be done to reach that state.

And now, we [ITERATE](prototype-phase.html).
