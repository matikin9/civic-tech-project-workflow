# Discovery Phase

You are in the Discovery Phase!  You've got a general idea of what you're interested in and maybe you've got a lot of questions.  It's time to focus on a direction.

Here are some questions to help you out:

* What is everyone on the team interested in?
* What do they know?
* What do they not know?
* Who do you want to help?
* What are the problems being faced?
* How could you address the problems?
* What would an MVP look like?
* How feasible is the MVP?

Do some resource gathering!  Here are some websites you can look at:

* [Los Angeles County](http://www.lacounty.gov)
* [City of Los Angeles](http://www.lacity.org)
* [Los Angeles County Open Data Portal](http://data.lacounty.gov)
* [City of Los Angeles Open Data Portal](http://data.lacity.org)

What are other websites (government, non-profit, existing projects) that are relevant to your project?

## Goal

Come up with a clear and concise single sentence answer for each of these questions:
* What is the problem?
* Who does it affect?
* Why this is important?
* What is the solution?
